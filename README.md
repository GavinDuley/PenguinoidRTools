# PenguinoidRTools
R functions that I made
* *aovSummaryTable*: This function takes a dataframe and returns a summary 
table of key ANOVA results without an interaction model.
* *aovInteractSummaryTable*: This function takes a dataframe and returns a
summary table of key ANOVA results for a two-way interaction model.
(Note that this is not currently working properly due to a bug that I am yet to resolve, as of 12th Apr 2024).
